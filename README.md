## Overview

This is a web server that serves dynamic image content for code repository
READMEs. It is similar in principle to [shields](https://shields.io/), but is
focused on more specific goals. The actual content is generated by shell
scripts, and designed to be statically hosted by practically any kind of web
server (Nginx, Apache, even busybox httpd), but comes packaged with a simple
Express.js server.

The execution of this idea is a bit sloppy in my opinion, but it gets the job
done, and I need it for some other repositories.

## API

"API" may be a bit of a misnomer, but there are particular routes that are
generated for the targets that are specified in the JSON manifest file. Right
now, those routes are:

### `reponame`/banner.svg

Return a banner that contains the human readable repository name, an associated
symbol, and a three-line description of the repository.

### `reponame`/banner-slim.svg

Same as above, but with less wasted space.

## Dashboard

At the document root, there is an index file that shows previews of all of the
banners, and provides a way to experiment with color combinations.

## Dependencies

```
curl
jq
node.js
npm
```

## Credits

I took some color combination ideas from
[colorion.co](https://2colors.colorion.co/).

The scripts in this repository take icons from [Google
Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
